/*
 * In this assignment, you will upgrade your previous Student Administrator program
 * Download Student Administrator program to include more advanced features using C++ structures (struct), file handling, and data manipulation.
 * This project simulates a small student database system, allowing you to efficiently manage academic information by adding, searching, and organizing student data.
 *
 * 1. Add a Search-by-ID Feature: Implement a function that allows users to search for a student by their ID number and display their details.
 *      Allow the user to enter a student ID and display all related information (name, ID, grade, email, major)
 *      If the ID does not exist show an appropriate message:
 *          "Student with that ID not found."
 *
 * 2. Show Only Students with Grade >= 70
 *      Add a new menu option to display only passing students (grade >= 70).
 *      Use a loop to filter and display these students.
 *
 * 3. Example Menu:
 * --- Student Administrator v2 ---
 * 1. Add Student
 * 2. Show All Students
 * 3. Show Students with Grade â‰¥ 70
 * 4. Search Student by ID
 * 5. Exit
