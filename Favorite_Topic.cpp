// /Write a C++ program that asks 5 multiple-choice questions about the Philadelphia Eagles, or another topic.
// Each question should have two possible answers.
// Use if statements to check if the userâ€™s response is correct:
// Award 20 points for a correct answer.
// Award 0 points for an incorrect answer.

// Display the total score at the end of the quiz.

// Use an if statement to evaluate the final score and display a message:

// If the score is greater than 80, display: "You are a champion!"

// 50 & 80 "You are almost a champion. Study more about the Philadelphia Eagles or....!"

// Otherwise, display: "Try again!. Study more about the Philadelphia Eagles or....!"
